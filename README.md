# Challenge

The problem
-When synthesizing chemicals we need to be able to keep track of each batch. For Intellectual Property reasons each batch needs to be assigned a unique ID. We are looking for a program/service to take a positive integer and generate a deterministic unique ID (meaning that if the same integer is passed twice it will return the same Unique ID both times even when the solution is restarted and any in memory indexes are lost) which conforms to the following:

Minimum of 4 characters up to a maximum of 6 characters in length
All letters should be uppercase.
The first character must be a letter, but not a vowel.
the remaining characters can be letters or numbers
Example:
(note: this is not an expected ID output but just an example of a valid result)
Input: 2
ID Output: K3B1
